# NewsApp-react
This is a react-based news application built with NewsApi.
NewsApi is free only for localhost and hence this website cannot be published for free using the free NewsApi Api key.
For testing purpose you can clone the repository on your local machine and run the site on localhost.
Please consider using your ApiKey stored in .env.local file in case the existing key gets exhausted.
